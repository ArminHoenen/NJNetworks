# NJNetworks

Here, the preliminary code for a commandline tool to obtain multiple trees for any input distance matrix from the NJ networks algorithm is available. Currently, only source code with rounding to next integer performed. If you would like to try the commandline tool, please contact hoenenarmin@gmail.com

The resulting multiple trees on the same dataset, which are all roughly equally probable may be used as input to networks based on multiple trees. Furthermore they may be used as a baseline against which more complex scenarios may be evaluated.

*Simulation study
The code for the simulation study comprises a first step, where distance matrices with a proportion of equal values are being produced.
