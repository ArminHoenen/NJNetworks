# NJNetworks

Here, the preliminary code for a commandline tool to obtain multiple trees for any input distance matrix from the NJ networks algorithm is available. Currently, only source code with rounding to next integer performed. If you would like to try the commandline tool, please contact hoenen@em.uni-frankfurt.de

*Simulation study
The code for the simulation study comprises a first step, where distance matrices with a proportion of equal values are being produced.
